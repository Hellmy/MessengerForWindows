Messenger For Windows Store
============================

The MessengerForWindows project is a Windows Store app that I built simply to get Facebook's new Messenger.com service (released yesterday) into a dockable app window that us Windows users can use. I built it in a little over 3 minutes (see the video) so others can see how easy it is to build apps. This is by no means production quality and certainly not an official Facebook app.

If you have any questions, feel free to ping me at elmer.morales@gmail.com or on Twitter at @elmerm. Enjoy!

##How To Install the App

Since this app isn't in the Windows Store, you'll need to use a method known as sideloading to run it on your Windows 8.1 PC. Please follow the steps below. 

1. From your Windows 8.1 PC, navigate to the 'AppPackages/MessengerForWindows_1.0.0.0_AnyCPU_Test' directory.
2. Find the file 'Add-AppDevPackage.ps1' and right click.
3. Select the "Run with Powershell" command from the right-click menu.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Once complete, the app should be available from your Start screen under the name "Messenger".
