Messenger For Windows Store
============================

The MessengerForWindows project is a Windows Store app that I built simply to get Facebook's new Messenger.com service (released yesterday) into a dockable app window that us Windows users can use. I built it in a little over 3 minutes (see the video) so others can see how easy it is to build apps. This is by no means production quality and certainly not an official Facebook app.

##To Install the App

Since this app isn't in the Windows Store, you'll need to use a method known as sideloading to run it on your Windows 8.1 PC. Please follow the steps below.
